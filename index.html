  <p> <b>Matlab : Medical imaging & Digital Image Processing</b> </p>
  <p>Utilizing Matlab coupled with the Signal Processing Toolbox, we were able to manipulate medical images in a variety of ways, which has tremendous real-world application, as we were able to see the importance of digital manipulation in order to identify certain aspects of an image more clearly and accuratly. This assignment utilized the following imaging techniques:
    Compression Algorithms
    RGB and HSV Components of Images
    Binary, Greyscale and Indexed representation of Images
    Usage Licensing
    Image Histogram Manipulation
    Image Histogram, Histogram Equalisation & Thresholding
    Image Mapping
    Pixel Degrees of Freedom
    Type Double
    2-Level Double Thresholding of Red Blood Cells
    Masking used to Extract Colors from Images
    Spatial Filtering
    Image Kernel
    Morphological Image Operators
    Functions for erosion & Dilation of a 3x3 kernel
    Effects of Opening cycles
    bwlabel function segmentation methods
    Intensity Manipulation 
    Low Pass Spatial Filters
    High Pass Spatial Filters
    Horizontal Gradient
    Vertical Gradient
    Laplacian
    Correlation & Convolution in image & signal processing
    Fourier Transform of images 
    Edge Detection of Images
    Basis Functions in Matlab
    Image Projection & Reconstruction
    Single line image projection intensities 
    Unfiltered Back Projection
    Filtered Back Projection</p>

    <p> <b>C++ Computer Game : Reversi /Othello</b> </p>
    <p>Successfully developed a computer game utilizing C++ in Code Blocks. The Game consisted of two algorithms that played against each other in a game of Othello/ Reversi. The size of the game board was variable and was the main input of the user in a .txt file.

        Upon the random moves of each of the algorithms, a record was kept in order to give a play-by-play summary of the results at the end. This was then sent to a .txt file. The Algorithm that manages to capture the most pieces on the board, wins.
